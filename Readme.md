# AI & ML Internship Task - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective:  
Understand the structure, patterns, trends, and anomalies of a dataset using visualizations and statistics.

Dataset Used:  
CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv

Tools/Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

---

 What I Did:

- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Generated histograms for numeric features
- Created boxplots to detect outliers
- Built a Correlation matrix heatmap to understand feature relationships
- Checked skewness to find non-normal distributions
- Detected outliers using the IQR method
- Made feature-level inferences from visuals

---

Key Learnings:

- Certain features like `selling_price` showed **positive skewness**.
- Some cars had extremely high `selling_price`, detected as **outliers**.
- Features like `year` and `selling_price` were weakly correlated.
- Strong importance of categorical variables like `fuel` and `transmission` was observed.
